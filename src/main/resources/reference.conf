    # external IP address and configure the gateway to allow traffic through. If the node succeeds, the IGD's external
    # IP address becomes the node's declared address.
    #
    # In some cases, you may both set `decalredAddress` and enable UPnP (e.g. when IGD can't reliably determine its
    # external IP address). In such cases the node will attempt to configure an IGD to pass traffic from external port
    # to `bind-address:port`. Please note, however, that this setup is not recommended.
